<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### ❌ The Problem  
GitHub's homepage sidebar used to show your **recent activity and pull requests**, making it easy to keep track of your work and contributions. However, this feature was removed, leaving users without a convenient way to quickly access their **open PRs, reviews, and recent activity** directly from the homepage.

### ✅ The Solution: GitHub Activity Restore  
**GitHub Activity Restore** is a **lightweight browser extension** that brings back the **Recent Activity** section to your GitHub homepage sidebar. It displays your **open pull requests, draft PRs, and recent contributions** in a clean, integrated interface that feels native to GitHub.

### 🛠️ How It Works  
🔹 **Seamless Integration** – Adds a "Recent Activity" section above the "Top Repositories" in your sidebar  
🔹 **Real-time Data** – Fetches your latest PRs and activity using GitHub's own APIs and page data  
🔹 **Native Feel** – Uses GitHub's authentic icons, colors, and styling for perfect integration  
🔹 **Smart Display** – Shows PR status (open/draft), repository info, and includes hover cards for detailed previews  

### 🎯 Why Use It?  
✨ **Stay Productive** – Quick access to your active work without navigating multiple pages  
⚡ **Save Time** – Instantly see your open PRs and their status from the homepage  
🎨 **Native Experience** – Looks and feels like a built-in GitHub feature  
🔄 **Always Updated** – Automatically refreshes to show your latest activity  

This extension is perfect for **developers, maintainers, and contributors** who want to quickly access their GitHub activity without losing the convenience that was once built into the platform! 🚀
